1. Define Your Goals and Features
Clearly outline the goals of your website and the features you want to include. Based on the provided details, here’s a list of key features:

User Features:

Browse products by category.
Add products to the cart and wishlist.
Checkout with multiple payment options (PayPal, credit card, bank transfer).

User authentication (login, register, Google login).
Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
Admin Features:

Manage products, categories, and inventory.
View and update orders.
Generate invoices.
Manage users and roles.
View sales reports and analytics.
2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Ensure your environment is ready for Laravel development:

Install Laravel 12.
Set up a local database (e.g., MySQL).
Install required packages (e.g., laravel/ui, paypal-checkout-sdk, intervention/image).
Use npm for frontend assets (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
3. Plan Your Database Structure
Design your database to support the features. Based on your requirements, here’s a suggested structure:

Users: Store user details, roles, and authentication data.
Products: Store product details, categories, and variants.
Orders: Store order details, including status, payment, and shipping information.
Cart: Store cart items for logged-in and guest users.
Wishlist: Allow users to save products for later.
Use Laravel migrations to create and manage your database tables.

4. Build the Backend
a. Authentication
Use Laravel’s built-in authentication scaffolding (php artisan ui bootstrap --auth).
Add Google login using laravel/socialite.
b. Product Management
Create models, controllers, and views for products and categories.
Use intervention/image for image uploads and resizing.
Add product filtering (e.g., by category, price range).
c. Shopping Cart
Create a CartController to handle adding, updating, and removing items.
Support guest users by storing cart data in sessions.
d. Checkout and Payment
Create a CheckoutController to handle the checkout process.
Integrate PayPal and credit card payments.
Store shipping and payment details in the database.
e. Order Management
Create an OrderController for users to view their orders.
Create an Admin/OrderController for admins to manage orders.
5. Build the Frontend
a. Responsive Design
Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts.
Ensure the website is mobile-friendly.
b. Blade Templates
Use Blade components for reusable elements (e.g., header, footer, product cards).
Use @yield and @section for dynamic content.
c. Dynamic Features
Use JavaScript (or Vue.js/React if needed) for dynamic features like sliders, modals, and AJAX-based cart updates.
6. Admin Dashboard
Create an admin panel for managing products, orders, and users.
Use middleware to restrict access to admin routes.
Add charts and reports for analytics.
7. Testing and Optimization
Write unit and feature tests for critical functionality (e.g., checkout, order management).
Optimize database queries using eager loading.
Use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., categories, featured products).
8. Deployment
Use a hosting platform like Laravel Forge, Vercel, or DigitalOcean.
Set up a production database and configure .env for production.
Use SSL for secure transactions.
9. Post-Launch
Monitor performance and fix bugs.
Add new features based on user feedback.
Regularly update dependencies and Laravel versions.
